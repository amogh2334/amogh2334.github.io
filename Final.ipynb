    "Since the creation of basketball, the sport has undergone lots of change which include rule changes and new tactics applied by each team. The 3 point line was brought into the NBA during the 1980 season, this rule change had a huge impact on how teams strategized and played each game. Recently the 3 point shot has increased in popularity and has lead coaches and analysts to believe that the 3 point shot has a huge impact on the success of an NBA team in today's current era. \n",

    "Our group wanted to explore how 3 point shooting affects the success of a team over the course of a season. More specifically how does the quantity of three point shots attempted per game and 3 point percentage affect win percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the general trend of the NBA we will be analyzing the average amount of 3 pointers attempted and made by all teams in the NBA. This will show if NBA teams are shooting more or less 3’s now vs in the past. \n",

    "With an understanding of the general trend of the NBA we will be able to apply that and analyze how the amount of 3 pointers attempted and 3 point percentage affect win percentage. \n"

    "For our data collection, we decided to use Basketball Reference as our main site to get data about every team's stats during the season. We decided to pick seasons starting at 1996-1997 and ending at 2018-2019, while not including 1998-1999 and 2011-2012 seasons since those were lockout seasons and less games were played that year which could inflate some stat for the teams due to the less games that were played. To properly get the data that we needed for our project, we decided to get three different CSV files per season. The first dataset we got for the season was team stats per game, which we called table_year. This data set has statistics that the team had per game for the 82 game season. Some of the statistics that the table game were points scored, three pointers made, assists, rebounds. Pretty much any single game basketball stat was provided in this table. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second data set we had for each year was the team stats in total which we decided to call table_year_total. This is very much the same data set as the team stats per game data set, with the only change being that this data set provided totals of each stats. Rather than giving how many points were scored per game, this data set instead gave how many points were scored totally the whole season. This was useful for us as it gave actual numbers rather than averages of stats so we could clearly see how many points were scored for example all season or how many three pointers were attempted all season. \n",
    "\n",
    "The third data set we had for each season was the standings data set which we called table_year_record. This data set had stats about the team's record that season and gave other stats such as home record and away record. This table was used only to get the total wins the team had this season."

    "This line graph shown above plots the average 3 point attempts for all the teams combined each year from 1997-1998 season to the 2018-2019 season. It shows how the NBA was moving from more of a 2 point game to shooting more 3 pointers. It shows a linear growth of 3 point attempts growing from a little above an average of 1000 3 point attempts a year to 2007 to about 1500 attempts between 1997 and 2007. After this 10 year period, there is a 4 year time period of no increase, which is most likely because the league had shot so many more 3 pointers the years before. After 2011,  there was a sharp increase in 3 point attempts which is likely because of new players coming into the league who practiced shooting threes more and coaches probably copied other coaches' offensive strategies causing all the teams to average more. The rise of the Splash Brothers (Steph Curry and Klay Thompson) and James Harden, who all shot the most threes the league has ever seen, likely caused the slope of this graph to increase. This first graph does not show how well the teams were doing as a result of their emphasis on 3 point attempts."

    "This scatter plot shows the the avearge 3 pointers attempted between 2008 and 2014 and graphs then compared to the average win percentage during the time period. We took into account the Brooklyn Nets and New Orleans Pelicans because they relocated or had new team names. The graph shows the amount of attempts ranging from about 1300 to 1800 with a few outliers. These outliers had similar win percentages, which means they likely they either had very high 2 point percentages or were average at shooting threes. The reason why some teams did poorly while averaging more 3 pointers was most likely because of their shot percentage."

    "This scatter plot shows the the avearge 3 pointers attempted between 2014 and 2019 and graphs then compared to the average win percentage during the time period. The graph shows the amount of attempts ranging from about 1800 to 2600 with a 2 outliers. The first outlier that is less than 1800 has one of the lowest win percentages and the the other which is nearly 3200 has one of the highest. It is clear from this graph that 3 point attempts drastically increased during this time period and it generally helps to shoot more 3 pointers."

    "After reviewing the data and models, we were able to get a good sense of the 3 point shot and how it has affected the success of teams in the NBA. Over the course of the history of the NBA, it has been clear NBA teams are shooting more 3 pointers than ever before. The strategy of the game is moving towards more 3 point attempts and is favoring players who shoot the ball at a higher percentage compared to the NBA in the 90s. In the last 5 years especially teams have significantly shot more 3 pointers. However, based on our models relating 3 point attempts to win percentage, there isn’t a clear correlation that shooting more 3’s will lead to a more successful season.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we analyzed the correlation between 3 point percentage and win percentage, there was a correlation between the two. The 2014-2019 graph shows this correlation the best. This was also the years NBA teams shot the most amount of 3’s. Generally the higher percent a team shot from behind the arc led to more games won. \n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA isn’t just a shooting competition, half the game is defense and a lot of the points come from shots in the paint. Some of the data could also be skewed on how contested the shots attempted were. We estimate the 3 point shot will continue to be popular into the future."
